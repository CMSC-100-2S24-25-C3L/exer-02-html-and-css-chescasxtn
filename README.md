**What are you key takeaways from this exercise?**
The exercise taught me how to build a single-page static website while maintaining proper image paths for deployment to GitHub Pages. I discovered that local file paths do not workÂ online, and that images must be referenced via relative paths or correctly hosted links. Furthermore, delivering the portfolio allowed me to learn about version control and the deployment process, emphasizing the necessity of debugging and troubleshooting in web development.
